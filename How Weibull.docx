The duration of data and the scale of analysis (e.g., 12 lakh smart meters in a region) are important considerations when performing Weibull analysis. 
Let’s break this down step by step:
________________________________________
1. Duration of Data
The duration of data required for Weibull analysis depends on the lifespan of the smart meters and the failure patterns you want to analyze. 
Here’s how to determine the required data duration:
Key Considerations:
•	Infant Mortality (Early Failures):
  o	If you want to analyze early failures (e.g., defects from manufacturing or installation), you need data from the first few months or years of operation.
  o	Example: Collect data for the first 1–2 years.
•	Random Failures:
  o	If you’re analyzing random failures (e.g., due to environmental factors or usage patterns), you need data over a moderate period (e.g., 3–5 years).
•	Wear-Out Failures:
  o	If you’re analyzing wear-out failures (e.g., due to aging or component degradation), you need data over a longer period (e.g., 5–10 years or more).
Rule of Thumb:
•	Collect data for at least 1–2 times the expected lifespan of the smart meters.
•	If the expected lifespan is 10 years, aim for at least 10–20 years of data for a comprehensive analysis.

2. Scale of Analysis (12 Lakh Smart Meters)
Analyzing data for 12 lakh (1.2 million) smart meters is a large-scale task, but Weibull analysis can still be applied effectively. Here’s how:
Key Considerations:
•	Data Aggregation:
  o	You don’t need to analyze each meter individually. Instead, aggregate the data into meaningful groups (e.g., by region, installation year, or usage pattern).
  o	Example: Group meters by installation year and analyze each group separately.
•	Sampling:
  o	If the dataset is too large, you can use statistical sampling to select a representative subset of meters for analysis.
  o	Ensure the sample is large enough to capture the failure patterns accurately.
•	Censored Data:
  o	Since not all meters will have failed by the time of analysis, you’ll need to account for censored data (meters that are still operational).
  o	Example: If a meter has been operational for 5 years without failure, it’s censored at 5 years.
•	Parallel Processing:
  o	For large datasets, use tools like Python’s multiprocessing or distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Spark) to speed up the analysis.

Steps to Perform Weibull Analysis for 12 Lakh Meters
1.	Data Collection:
  o	Collect failure times (for failed meters) and censored times (for operational meters).
  o	Include metadata like installation date, region, and usage patterns.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
  o	Clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, remove outliers).
  o	Group the data into meaningful categories (e.g., by region or installation year).
3.	Weibull Analysis:
  o	Use Python code to fit Weibull distributions to each group.
  o	Estimate the shape (β) and scale (η) parameters for each group.
4.	Visualization:
  o	Plot the reliability function, failure rate, and probability plots for each group.
  o	Compare results across groups to identify trends.
5.	Interpretation:
  o	Identify failure patterns (e.g., early failures, random failures, wear-out failures).
  o	Use the results to optimize maintenance schedules, improve manufacturing processes, or allocate resources.

Example Workflow for Large-Scale Analysis
Suppose we have data for 12 lakh meters installed over the past 10 years. Here’s how you can approach the analysis:

Step 1: Group Data
Group meters by installation year (e.g., 2013–2023).
For each group, collect failure times and censored times.

Step 2: Perform Weibull Analysis
Use Python to fit Weibull distributions for each group.
